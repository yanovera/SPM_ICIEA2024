# Spherical Parallel Manipulator (SPM) Reinforcement Learning Project

This project uses reinforcement learning (RL) to control a Spherical Parallel Manipulator (SPM). The project includes scripts for training RL models, evaluating them against a classic control method, and visualizing the results.

## Project Overview
The project consists of three main scripts:
1. `train.py`: Trains RL models using the `SPMEnv` environment.
2. `evaluate.py`: Evaluates the trained models against a classic control method and visualizes the results.
3. `animate_with_lasers.py`: Animates a Blender model of the SPM using data from a single evaluation log file.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install the required packages.
3. Run the desired script.

## Usage
1. `train.py`: To train an RL model, run this script. You can adjust the training parameters as needed.
2. `evaluate.py`: To evaluate the trained models, run this script. You can adjust the evaluation parameters as needed.
3. `animate_with_lasers.py`: To animate the Blender model, run this script in Blender. Ensure the log file path and name are correctly set in the script.
